Hello!
I am currently finishing my PhD and looking for new opportunities, such as postdoctoral research positions.
My general interests reside in deep learning, optimization, computer vision, and natural language processing. During my PhD, I focused mainly on two fields of deep learning optimization: distributed learning and local learning.

My PhD was done at Sorbonne Université, in the Machine Learning & Deep Learning for Information Access ([MLIA](https://www.isir.upmc.fr/equipes/mlia/)) team of the Institut des systèmes intelligents et robotique (ISIR) laboratory. I worked under the supervision of Edouard Oyallon within the [ADONIS](https://adonis-research.github.io/) research project.
I followed the Cursus Ingénieur of Ecole Polytechnique from 2016 to 2020. I was also enrolled from 2020 to 2021 in the engineering cursus of Télécom Paris and the Research Master MVA (Maths, Vision, Learning) of ENS Paris-Saclay. I did two research internships, at [Gleamer](https://www.gleamer.ai/) and at the [CoML](https://cognitive-ml.fr/) (Cognitive Machine Learning) team of INRIA Paris.
